## About The Project

Kozilek, The Sentinel, is not just another verification bot. It is an intelligent, self-improving security system designed to protect Discord communities. Named after the Eldrazi titan known for distorting reality, Kozilek warps its own defensive logic to counter emerging threats.

The core problem with traditional verification systems is their static nature; once a bypass is found, it can be exploited repeatedly. Kozilek solves this by leveraging an AI model that **learns from failed and successful verification attempts**. It analyzes patterns and techniques used to fool the system and integrates countermeasures, ensuring it's always one step ahead.

### Key Features ‚ú®

- **üß† AI-Powered Verification**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to analyze verification data, going beyond simple checks.
- **üîÑ Adaptive Learning**: The system continuously trains itself on new data to identify and neutralize novel bypass techniques.
- **üîí Privacy-Focused**: Designed from the ground up to handle user data with the utmost care. All sensitive information is processed securely and never stored unnecessarily.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Simple Integration**: Get Kozilek set up in your server with a few simple commands.
