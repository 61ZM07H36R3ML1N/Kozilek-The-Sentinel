## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Kozilek, The Sentinel, seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

In your email, please include:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that can help us understand the issue.
- Your contact information (optional, but helpful if we need to ask follow-up questions).

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the issue. We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:

- Promptly addressing all reported security vulnerabilities.
- Keeping you informed about the status of your report.
- Crediting responsible disclosures (if you wish to be credited).

Thank you for helping to keep Kozilek, The Sentinel, secure for everyone.
